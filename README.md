# Data_Mining_Project
## Introduction
In most countries and education systems, final score and GPA is an important measure of student academic achievement. It helps university and potential employer to compare and select candidates with higher final score and GPA. One of the major task of college is to find the factors that affect final score and can be used to predict result, finally help student to achieve the best result. There are two goals in this project. The first one is select variables which have significant effect on underperformance and classify the underperformance. The second one is to recommend student the suitable subject, STEM subjects or non-STEM subjects, to maximize their final score based on NAPLAN score, first math score and first English score. This project use Maching Leaning technique to do data mining and find interesting patterns.

## Main parts of project
1. Introduction -- Context and Problem Description

2. Data Description, Data Quality Aeeseement and Exploratory Data Analysis

3. Data pre-processing

4. Final Score Prediction include Linear Model and Neural Network

5. Underperformance Classification include Decision Tree and SVM

6. Method justification and limitation

7. Results and summary

8. Conclusion and future work

## Main tasks
•	Implement data exploration and quality assessment, identify main issues of dataset

•	Pre-process data and fix identified issues, prepare data for machine learning

•	Build statistical model and neural network to determine useful factors and predict final score

•	Implement decision tree and support vector machine (SVM) to classify underperformance student and achieve excellent result with AUC score 90%.

•	Depending on model result, provide appropriate solution to students and help them maximize final score
