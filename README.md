# Data_Mining_Project
## Introduction
In most countries and education systems, final score and GPA is an important measure of student academic achievement. It helps university and potential employer to compare and select candidates with higher final score and GPA. One of the major task of college is to find the factors that affect final score and can be used to predict result, finally help student to achieve the best result. There are two goals in this project. The first one is select variables which have significant effect on underperformance and classify the underperformance. The second one is to recommend student the suitable subject, STEM subjects or non-STEM subjects, to maximize their final score based on NAPLAN score, first math score and first English score.
